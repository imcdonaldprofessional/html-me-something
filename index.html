                <p>
                    Back in July 2020, a game called Internet League Blaseball, or just
                     "Blaseball," went live. A play on the popular sport, Blaseball is a 
                     weird, fantastical version of Baseball, although most Blaseball fans 
                     will pretend not to know what you're talking about when you mention
                     Baseball. If you log on to blaseball.com, depending on what day of the
                     week it is, all you'll see is twenty teams, constantly playing games
                     every hour, on the hour. 
                </p>

                    <h2 id="section2">How do you play?</h2>
                    <p>Well, you don't play Blaseball, so much as you participate in it.
                        Mechanically, whenever you sign up, you select a favorite team.
                        Whenever your team wins a game, you're gifted a small amount of "coins."
                        You can use these coins to place bets on games, earning more money and 
                        being able to place larger bets as time goes on.
                        
                    </p>

                    <p>You might be asking yourself, "why do I care how much money I make
                        bidding on this fake internet sports thing?" One of the things that 
                        makes Blaseball so interesting is that at the end of each season,
                        fans are allowed to use their money to purchase votes, just like in
                        real life. These votes can be cast towards "Blessings" that improve various
                        elements of their favorite team. Initially, these were very straightforward, but as
                        time has gone on, things have gotten a bit more complicated.

                    <h2 id="section3">Okay then, how do I "participate?"</h2>
                    <p>So, first thing you want to do is join a team! There's no real trick to picking your favorite.
                        Some folks pick the team closest to their hometown, others just pick one that sounds fun. Each team
                        has a different personality informed by lots of small details.
                    </p>
                    <p>For example, the Baltimore Crabs have a very active fanbase. As a vocal, organized group, they were able
                        to push harder than most teams for coordination in post-season voting. These tactics paid off in securing the 
                        Crabs lots of Blessings and made them the first team to win three championships, but combined with their
                        overactive fans, it also characterized them as "heels," the villains of Blaseball.

                    <p>That's a very fair question! Obviously the actual interface for Blaseball is pretty minimalist, but 
                        the fan community on Discord, a chat room service, is extremely active.

                    </figcaption>
                    <p>People are constantly creating 'lore' for Blaseball events or characters, some fans even run twitter accounts dedicated
                        to roleplaying a specific Blaseball character. Teams will come up with involved backgrounds for characters based
                        on statistical extrapolation. For example, the Yellowstone Magicâœ¨have a player named 'Chorby Short' who seems
                        be walked an improbably high number of times despite awful Batting ability, and so the Magic decided that Chorby
                        was a frog with an extremely small strike zone.                         
                    </p>
                    <img src="blaseball pics/chorbyshort.jpg">
                    <figcaption>Fans will chant "Chorby Short, Chorby Strong, Chorby Make the Inning Long!" when Chorby is up to 
                        bat, a reference to how Chorby's at-bats can slow down any Yellowstone games several innings behind the rest
                        of the teams.

                    <p>Or take the Seattle grunge-rock themed team, The Garages. Many of the Seattle Garages fans are actual musicians and
                        they've composed several full-length albums and EP's full of Blaseball inspired music. They've raised tons of money
                        for charity organizations, and the music is actually good!

                    <p>That's the reaction a lot of folks have, and honestly? There's not that much to get. That's part of what I love
                        about Blaseball. You don't have to dig any deeper than 'make-believe' baseball and you can still enjoy it
                        for what it is. Some weeks I'm busy, and I don't have much time to follow the season. I might check the scoreboard a couple
                        times throughout the day to check on my team(the Houston Spies ðŸ•µ) and leave it at that.

                    <p>Other times, I can really use a distraction from life, and there's an endless wave of activity for me to sink into. There's
                        always some new thing just around the corner that changes how the game is played entirely, or random secret events no one
                        expected, or even just other fans providing real play by play commentary over Twitch&#8482;. The thing that blows me away is 
                        how much has been built out of so little. As someone interested in both game design and web design, I have huge admiration
                        for how they've built out a compelling narrative with a simple UI, almost entirely free art assets, and clever writing.
